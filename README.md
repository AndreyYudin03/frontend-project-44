# This project consists of 5 console math games.

## "Parity Check" (brain-even):

The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it is odd.

## "Calculator" (brain-calc):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 24 + 76, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

## "NODE" (brain-gcd):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 24 36. The user must calculate and enter the largest common divisor of these numbers.

## "Arithmetic progression" (brain-progression):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, one random number will be hidden. The player must determine this number.

## "Is a prime number?" (brain-prime):

The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number, for example, 11. The user must determine whether this number is prime.

At the beginning of each game, you will be greeted and asked your name. The number of rounds in each game is 3. If the user gives an incorrect answer, the game will end and the player will know which answer was correct.
